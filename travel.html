            <h3><strong>Why is it important to monitor your credit score?</strong></h3>
            <p> A good credit score can make your financial life easier. You’ll have easier access to large loans such as a
                mortgage or auto loan with better terms. These terms can save you money over the long term and allow you to work 
                towards your other financial goals such as retirement or building a safety net before deciding to work for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>On the flip side, a bad credit score can lead to difficulty obtaining large loans with favorable terms. If you are able 
                to secure a loan with bad credit, then you will likely be paying higher rates. Your higher payments can add up and make it more difficult to save for your other financial goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have plans to make a major purchase with the help of a loan, then you will want a good credit score. Consider whether or not you see a home purchase or auto loan in your future. 
                If you do plan on making a major purchase with the help of a lender, then you will likely need a good credit score to make that transaction flow as smoothly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, is incredibly important to monitor your credit score. Not only can your actions have a big impact on your credit score, but also mistakes on your credit report can lead to a misleading score. 
                For example, if a creditor accidentally reports a defaulted loan on your credit report, it could lead to a big drop in your credit score through no fault of your own. That could lead to problems securing 
                a mortgage or auto loan down the line.
            </p>
            <p>You can save yourself a lot of headaches by monitoring your credit score on a regular basis. If you can catch mistakes early, then you can take action to remove the false information from your credit report. 
                If the mistake goes unnoticed, it can be more difficult to remove it from your credit history in the future.
